# Restaurant website project
A static, minimalistic [website](https://joshjulius.github.io/landing-page-project/#/) for a mock restaurant. Mobile and desktop friendly. Content is still at a bare minimum.

## What I learned by building this project
- CSS
  - Variables
  - Mobile first design
  - Animations
- Hamburger menu using JS
- React Router

## What I would like to do next
- [ ] Add content
- [ ] Improve the UI
- [ ] Add testing
- [ ] Contact local restaurants/businesses to offer them this website for use
- [ ] Integrate a CMS like strapi.io
